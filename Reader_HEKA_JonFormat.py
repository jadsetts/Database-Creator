#This creates 'data', and 'notebook' which contains the data from your file and the metadata about individual scans.
#'data' and 'notebook' have corresponding positions, so scan 5's data can be found in data[4] and scan 5's metadata in notebook[4]
#'data' is currently a list of lists of lists. The top level is each series (64 long for test.asc), 
#the next level is each sweep (4 long for series 64 in test.asc, usually only 1 long), 
#and finally the data is stored in relatively the same format you would see if you opened test.asc in Excel to look at a sweep.
#If 'data' is consistently stored in this format, the function used after this one will work properly no matter what is stored in it.

#As for specifically whats going in for HEKA file reading, please refer to Danny!!!

    The data is comprised of each line of the HEKA.asc files as a list of items separated by a comma
    However, the data is not organized in a way that is convenient for us
    Also the values of the measurement are in a weird string format that is not appropriate for data treatment
    The data in the HEKA.asc is organized this way each 
        - Series_X_X: Each series correspond to a bunch of measurement and for mapping it is one coordinate of the map
            - Sweeps from measurement: Each sweeps contains the data from the measurement and is usually comprised of 5 columns (index, time, I, time, E)
                                        you can have multiple sweeps per series for example OCP and the then LSV
            - Notebook information: Additionnal data from HEKA that give us information from the experiment
                                        There is only one entry of the notebook per serie and it is always the last element of the serie
            
    To organize the data we will read trhough the data variable line per line
    and based on the values read of the first item of the line we can determine what kind of information is stored in the line
    
    We are reading the first item of the data line so it will be data[0] or n[0] in this case
    We identify using the command re.search which looks for a cluster of character in a list of string
    
        - If it's a serie -> you can identify using "Serie"
        - If it's a sweep -> you can identify using "Sweep_"
        - If it's a notebook entry -> you can identify using "sweep #"
        - A data entry for a measurement -> you can identify using " "
    
    However both the sweep and notebook data entry have " " as an identifier so we need an additional identifier
    To do we add a tracker 'sweep_tracker' and 'meta_tracker'
    They start at 0 to indicate that they are inactive
    If we identify a sweep it will also trigger the change to make sweep_tracker active and notebook_tracker inactive
    Conversely, if we identify a notebook it will also trigger the change to make sweep_tracker inactive and notebook_tracker active
    
    Based on these identifier and tracker we can make an algorithm that will place the data in a list of list that have the data conveniently placed in the following order
    
    Level 1 -> Master list: each element is a serie
     level 2 -> Serie list: each element is a sweep
         level 3 -> Sweep list: each element the data form a measurement
             level 4 -> Column: each element consist of the type of the attribute of the measurement (potential, time, current, ...)
