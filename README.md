# Database-Creator

This series of files will read data into a specific format. Ideally, in the future, there will be many types of reader programs that all have the exact same output. These readers will output the exact same objects. These objects will then be placed into an HDF5 file that will be acting as a database to store all data, notebook information and data-specific information. This database is searchable and will ideally be used by research groups to be able to look at past students work, or perform large data analyses on many data scans.
